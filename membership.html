<h1>Leeds Night Owls Membership</h1>
<p>Night Owls is a membership organisation and charges a yearly membership fee and weekly fees used to pay for insurance at the venue and for rent on the room at The Cardigan Centre. Any surpluses are ploughed back into the club. You need to pay a modest yearly membership fee if you wish to attend. Also, each time you attend a weekly meeting there is a small fee to pay.
