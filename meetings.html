<h1>Leeds Night Owls Meetings</h1>
<p>The club meets at <a href="https://cardigancommunitycentre.org/">The Cardigan Centre</a> in the <em>Hyde Park Room</em> which is the large room on the ground floor. The club has a large storage room where all of the club's scenery, 6' x 4' boards, battle matts and the like are stored. There are also a lot of smaller boards for use with games like Blood Bowl and the like.</p>
<p>The club has a lot of wargaming terrain for many different scales including 6mm, 15mm and 28mm as well as historical, sci-fi and fantasy terrain. Members have terrain for pretty well any scale you can mention. The big benefit of gaming at the club, is that you just need your wargaming miniatures, some dice and whatever wargaming rules you are playing. Everything else is available at the club.</p>
<h2>Tuck Shop</h2> 
<p>There are refreshments available at the club, tea and coffee as well as a range of soft drinks for a modest charge. There are also a range of chocolate bars and biscuits available too if you're feeling peckish.</p>
<h2>Everyone Gets a Game Philosophy</h2>
<p>Whatever happens you are always guaranteed a game whether you've organised a game or not. At every meeting there is always at least one table anybody can play at. The games vary widely, but the table usually focuses more on board games, card games or something like <a href="https://www.zombicide.com/">Zombicide</a>. Sometimes there's even some variant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> on offer.</p>

<p>Don't worry if you don't have a game planned, you will not be left twiddling your thumbs.</p>
<h2>How do I Arrange a Game?</h2>
<p>You can arrange a game in a number of ways. The most common is to arrange them in person at the club. Usually, games are arranged the week before for the following Sunday. The next most common way is to arrange the game via the club Facebook page. That tends to be where club duscussion happens outside of club meetings.</p>
