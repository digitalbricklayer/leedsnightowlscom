<h1>Games Played at Night Owls</h1>
<p>Quite a wide range of games are played at the club. The club does <em>not</em> dictate what games members are able to play.</p>
<p>The following games have been played at the club over the last few months just to give you an idea of the games that are typically played. If a game is not in the list below, that does not mean that the game cannot be played. It just means that it hasn't been played. Again, the club is not at all prescriptive of the games people play.</p>
<h2>The Games</h2>
<p>This is not an exhaustive list, but covers most of the most popular ones.</p>
<h2>Bolt Action</h2>
<p>Bolt Action has been a regular at the club for many years with most members being familiar with the rules. We are moving over to version 3 at the moment.</p>
